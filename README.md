This repo contains all of the work I did for CS510-- Advance Java programming at PSU. Over the course of 8 weeks, we were tasks with creating an application that would allow a user to store and display phone bill information. A user would be able to add calls, add new bills, display, filter, etc. All of the assignments were written in Java. The final project was an android app with similar functionality developed using the AndroidStudio IDE.
